# In-Class Programming Activity, Day 7

## Katya Kelly
## Date: 16 February 2017

## Task 1
```{r}
vals <- rexp(10, rate = 1/100)
```

## Task 2
```{r}
test200 <- sum(log(dexp(vals, rate = 1/200)))
```

## Task 3
```{r}
LL_exp <- function(rate) {
  test_rate <- sum(log(dexp(vals, rate = rate)))
  return(test_rate)
}

LL_exp(rate = 1/200)
```

The result is very close to what I got in part 2 (the difference is due to the vals not being exactly the same).

## Task 4
```{r}
rates <- c(seq(1/200, 1/50, length.out = 100))
```

## Task 5
```{r}
results <- sapply(rates, LL_exp)
```

## Task 6
```{r}
plot(1/rates, results)
```


## Task 7
```{r}
exp_results <- optimize(LL_exp, 
                        lower = 1/200, upper = 1/50,
                        maximum = TRUE)

exp_results
```

## Test statements

```{r}
